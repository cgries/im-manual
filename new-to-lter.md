# Welcome to the LTER community!#

Although each of the sites and roles are a bit different, overall, the LTER Network is a truly congenial, helpful, and welcoming community. 
These pages are intended to help you find your way around our various communication channels in your first weeks and months. For resources specific to information management, please see [new-to-im](new-to-im.md).

## How to get connected:

*  LTER mailing lists: Each committee has an email discussion list. For information managers, the posting address is <im@lternet.edu>.
