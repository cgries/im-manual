## Editing Pages Directly

You can make modest edits directly in your browser as long as you are signed in to GitHub.
If you have access to the repository, you can edit it directly.
Otherwise, GitHub will handle the fork-commit-pullrequest process (i.e., the Git workflow) for you, and your edit will be reviewed by a member of the repository.

We recommend this workflow for editing pages directly in your browser:

1. From the [home page for the repo](https://github.com/lter/im-manual), either find and click the file you want to edit, or **Add file > Create new file** to create a new file.
2. If creating a new file for the final rendered website, give the filename a **.md** extension and use dashes instead of spaces, e.g., `my-new-file.md`.
3. Make your edits in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
4. Click the **Preview** tab to see how your edits might look when rendered.  Note that the rendering into HTML may look different than the GitHub preview, but as long as the basics are there (e.g., bulleted lists come out as bulleted lists, links aren't garbled), things should be fine.
5. Scroll to the bottom and add a description about the edit you made.
6. Click the green button to finish your edit.  The text of the green button varies depending on your permissions and what you're doing, but it will say something like Commit new file, Commit changes, or Propose changes.
7. If you have permission to edit the repo directly, you can wait a few minutes and then view the [rendered result](https://lter.github.io/im-manual/) to make sure it looks good.

That's it!  Thanks for your help!
