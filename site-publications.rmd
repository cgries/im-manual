Download and install the Zotero desktop client and the browser add on for whichever browser you are using. 
To facilitate sharing of pubs that meet the criteria for inclusion in the Network bibliography, it's helpful to add a "for the Network" collection. Collections operate like tags. There's only one copy of the record -- it just appears in multiple collections. So when you update it (with, say added tags or a print publication date), it is updated in all the collections within your library where it exists.
Import your publications to your desktop Zotero client.
Sync your desktop client with your online group library.
Invite Marty (lternco@gmail.com or LTER Network) to your group library.
When you do a significant update to your library, let me know and I'll drag the new publications from your library to the Network library and sync them so they appear in the LTER Network bibliography.
There is not currently a way to autosync group libraries (which is probably a wise thing)
After I update, I'll search and resolve duplicates. This is a quick process for a few publications, but even so, it adds up for hundreds. So it's helpful to know what the cutoff point was when we last synced.

FAQ’s

Q: Do you have the publications from our most recent annual report.
A: I do not receive your annual reports. The LTER Network Office is not part of NSF and NSF has very strict rules about who they share information with. The only way I would receive your annual report is if you send it to me. 

Q: Where did you get those most recent papers?
A: I have a Web of Science alert set up for anything that has “LTER” or "Long Term Ecological Research" in the funding acknowledgements. We get about 30 hits per month on those (for all of LTER) and I add them to our Zotero library (tagged with the appropriate site) when they come in. That's where the newer articles came from. This is what allows us to keep the Network bibliography reasonably current. Otherwise, we would always be a year or more out of date.

Q: I see articles without dates or with only partial titles
A: Articles without dates probably were incomplete in the original file I received or they have only been published online, not yet in print at the time I received them. 

Q: 	Hi zotero gurus. I am contemplating drinking the zotero koolaid for our pub list. Starting by making the updates for @mdowns request. I looks like Marty last year requested entry types here https://lternet.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LTER-Network-Publications-and-Products-Instructions.pdf that do not exactly match the entry types that zotero defaults when you add to the collection (e.g. zotero thinks something is a 'Journal Article' while in Marty/NSF land this is an 'article'). Is there a quick way to change the types within zotero that does not involve clicking on each article? Or am I misunderstanding that for integration into the master LTER collection we need to reassign the types?

A: 	Zotero’s journal article = Marty’s article. Apologies for my inadequately precise language. :wink: I was trying to make the LNO request conform as much as possible to the NSF request. 

The place where item types mostly become a challenge is conference “papers.”  Many sites have entered conference presentations (i.e. abstracts) as conference papers, but they aren’t the same thing. Juried conference papers (where a full paper results and is reviewed and published) should be added to Zotero as conference papers.  Abstracts of meeting presentations (which don’t appear as papers) should be entered in Zotero under the  “presentation” item type. Also — NSF wants to receive those in your annual reports.   We do not want to include them in the Network bibliography.
