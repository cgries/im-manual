# Site Personnel Lists 

## Overview
Marty is working on an overview diagram to go here that explains what kind of information is stored how in LTERHub. The biggest difference from past practice is that affiliations with sites or institutions are stored separately from the individual. 


## Individual updates

To add key personnel to your site between major updates, [create a ticket in LTERHub](https://lternetwork.force.com/lterhub/s/contactsupport) with their name, role, email address. The LNO will create a user for them and trigger a message to login and fill in other key information.

Once a user is created and they have logged in, they are able to update their own information including email (which automatically updates the login email), site and institutional affiliations, ORCID, social media accounts and research interests.

## Making bulk updates

Create an excel or csv file with the following headers that contains all the individuals that are (to the best of your knowledge) new to LTER. Upload the file as an attachment to a case in the LTERhub using the case reason "new participant."

|Site|First Name|Last Name|Middle Name|email address|Status\* |Site_Role_1\*\* |Role_1_end|Site_Role_2|Role_2_start|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|ABC|Jane|Q|Ecologist|jecologist@institution.edu|Current|Graduate Student|n/a|n/a|n/a|
|DEF|Joe|F|Biogeochemist|jbiogeochemist@institution.edu|Current|Information Manager|n/a|Investigator|2021|
|XYZ|James|T|Callahan|callahan@nsf.gov|Former|Investigator|1999|Retired|1999|

At the time they are added, each new participant will receive an automatic email from LTERHub with a welcome message and a link to set their password and update their profile with additional information such as their ORCID, institutional affiliations, a biographical statement, social media information, a photograph or avatar -- and demographic information. 

\* "Status" has 2 options: "Current" or "Former". This reflects an individuals affiliation with the site. All newly affiliated individuals should be listed as "Current." When an individual leaves your site, they should be identified as "Former" for your site and an end date entered for their role. When their status changes to "Former" at all sites with which they had an affiliation, their LTER status will automatically change to "Inactive". As long as they maintain an active affiliation with any LTER site, their LTER status will be "Active".

\** Options for "Role" are detailed below.

**The table above illustrates three common cases:**

* **New participants:** The only information required is Site, First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, Email address, Status, and Role. The remaining columns should have n/a's.  

* **Adding roles:** LTERHub is designed to accommodate multiple simultaneous role and site affiliations. When an individual adds a new role at your site and keeps the old role (as in an Information Manager became a co-PI), enter n/a in the <Role_1_end> column, add the new role in the <Role_2> column, and add the year the new role started in <Role_2_start> column.

* **Changing or ending roles:** If someone's role has changed (i.e. the previous role ended when the new role began, as in a graduate student became a postdoc), add the end date in the <Role_1_end> column. Add the new role and the year it started in <Role_2> and <Role_2_start> respectively.

    * **Other Professional:** A person who may or may not hold a doctoral degree or its equivalent, who is considered a professional and is not reported as a Principal Investigator, faculty associate, postdoctoral associate or student. Examples include research associates, physicians, veterinarians, system experts, computer programmers and design engineers.
     * **Technical/Research Staff:** Technicians and field research personnel. 
    * **Administrative Staff:** Persons working on the project in a non-research capacity. 
    * **Other Staff:** Persons working on the project in a non-research capacity, such as draftsmen, animal caretakers, electricians and custodial personnel. 
    * **Interested Party:** A person who is associated with an LTER site or the Network through interest, educational programs, public outreach etc.
