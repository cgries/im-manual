# Editing the IM Manual

We welcome edits to the IM manual.
You can make edits in a number of ways as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/lter/im-manual/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you just want to post a suggestion or comment, the simplest approach is to sign in and use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/lter/im-manual/issues).
Click the **New issue** button to get started.
You can use plain text to describe your issue, but if you want to take advantage of more advanced features, check out [GitHub's Quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart).
