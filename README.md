# im-manual
A place for new and experienced  LTER information managers to refer to the latest LTER policy and practice updates.

The LTER im-manual is intended for policies and practices that are LTER-specific, not as a replacement for broader training and best practices in information management. It is accessible by any LTER information manager, but will probably be most actively updated by the LTER Network Office and the LTER IMExec Team.
All LTER Information Managers will want to "watch" the repo for updates or check back regularly.

Contributions can be made in a number of ways:
-- For modest edits that have been agreed to in IMEXEC, please ask to join the repo and edit directly
-- for major proposed edits that require review, please fork the repo
-- to make suggestions or call attention to sections that require revisions, use issues
