# Site Websites

If you're one of those (un)lucky IMs who handles your LTER site's website, then read on.

How you go about creating or maintaining your site's website depends on the legacy of the existing website (if any), what resources are available to you at your institution, how much your site has budgeted for website work, and what your site needs from your website.
Some of the more common options across sites are listed below, as well as one new and interesting option.

## DEIMS

DEIMS (the Drupal Ecological Information Management System, depending on whom you ask), is a Drupal-based website solution developed in collaboration with several IMs.
For the public, it provides site information, a data catalog, bibliography, and personnel lists.
It manages the information for those items in a database, and it can export ecological metadata language (EML) documents from that database when it's time to archive a given data package.
Although DEIMS lost favor amongst some LTER sites after its initial release due to challenges in upgrading Drupal, that pain is (supposedly) mitigated in more recent Drupal versions, and several sites still use DEIMS.
If you already use DEIMS or Drupal, or the idea of a monolithic IM solution attracts you, reach out to the IMs at these sites to learn more: ARC, KNZ, MCM, PIE.

## WordPress

Many sites use WordPress for its ease of migration and editing.
However, a DEIMS-like solution doesn't exist for WordPress, so you will have to find a way to support interactive features such as a data catalog.

## Static Website

There are many [advantages to static websites](https://blog.squido.org/why-static-html/).
For example, you can typically find a free host for a static website, they're secure, and they can be blazingly fast.
While static websites used to be just for geeks, content management systems are evolving which make the editing experience more similar to WordPress or Drupal.
By harnessing the power of online services and APIs, static sites can include interactive features like data catalogs and bibliographies.

## DataONE Portal

For a relatively new paid option with simpler sites, you may be interested in [DataONE Portals](https://www.dataone.org/portals-tutorial/).  From DataONE:

> A portal is a collection of DataONE member node data packages on a unique webpage.

In other words, you can describe your project on your own portal page, and you can have a complete data catalog as long as all of your datasets are discoverable within DataONE.
If you need other fancy features though, you may need to look elsewhere.
